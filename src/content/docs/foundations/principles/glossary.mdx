### Variable

A storage location in a program that holds a value, which can change during the execution of the program.

### Function

A block of code designed to perform a particular task, usually taking some input, processing it, and returning a result.

### Constant

A value that does not change during the execution of a program, often used to represent fixed data.

### Linter

A tool that automatically checks source code for programming errors, stylistic issues, and bugs.

### Magic Number

A unique value in code that appears without explanation and could be replaced by a named constant for better readability.

### Refactor

The process of restructuring existing code to improve its readability, efficiency, or structure without changing its external behavior.

SOLID Principles

### Class

A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming, defining the properties and behaviors that the objects created from it will have.

### Module

A self-contained piece of software that encapsulates a specific functionality, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

### Immutable Object

An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created, ensuring that its data remains consistent and unchangeable.

### Composition

A design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects, rather than inheriting from a parent class, to achieve greater flexibility.

### Interface

A contract in programming that defines a set of methods that a class must implement, promoting consistency and reusability across different parts of a system.

Advanced Concepts and Considerations

### Vulnerability

A weakness in a software system that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.

### User Testing

The practice of having real users interact with software to identify usability issues and gather feedback to improve the product.

### Modular Design

An approach to software design that breaks a system down into smaller, self-contained modules, each responsible for a specific part of the functionality.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

A lightweight format for storing and exchanging data, easily readable by humans and easily parsed by machines.

### Event Listener

A function in JavaScript (or other programming languages) that waits for a specific event, such as a mouse click or keypress, and responds by executing a defined action.

### Object Pooling

A performance optimization technique that involves reusing objects from a pool instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly, reducing memory and processing overhead.

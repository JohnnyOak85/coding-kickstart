## Best Practices

### Readability

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Select variable, function, file and folder names that clearly indicate their
    purpose, making it easier to understand the code's intent without additional
    comments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Line Length">
    Keep your lines under 80-100 characters to ensure the code is easily
    readable on any device or screen size.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Commenting">
    Use comments to explain the reasoning behind your code rather than what the
    code does. Utilize JSDoc for thorough documentation of functions and
    methods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Template Literals">
    Employ template literals for string concatenation to enhance readability and
    make the strings easier to manipulate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User-Facing Text">
    Centralize user-facing text into constants or configuration files to make
    updates easier and maintain consistency across the application.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Organization

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Declare Constants First">
    Begin with const declarations, followed by let to clearly separate immutable
    and mutable variables, enhancing structure and readability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Group Similar Logic Together">
    Organize related logic together to maintain a coherent structure, which aids
    in understanding and maintaining the code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Separate Business Logic from UI Logic">
    Isolate business logic from UI logic to create modular, testable, and
    maintainable code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modularize Your Code">
    Break your code into small, reusable modules, promoting better organization
    and ease of maintenance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit File Length">
    Keep files relatively short (e.g., under 300-400 lines) to improve
    readability and maintainability. Long files can be harder to navigate and
    understand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modularity">
    Ensure each module focuses on a single responsibility and can be easily
    reused or replaced. This promotes better code organization, enhances
    reusability, and simplifies testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adopt a Coding Standard">
    Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent coding styles and
    standards across your codebase. Consistency in coding style improves
    readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Maintainability

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Avoid Deep Nesting">
    Reduce deep nesting to simplify code structure, making it easier to follow
    and maintain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Default Parameters">
    Provide default values for function parameters to prevent issues with
    undefined values and improve function robustness.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid Magic Numbers">
    Replace hardcoded numbers with named constants to convey their meaning and
    facilitate easier updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Error Handling">
    Apply consistent and graceful error handling across the codebase using
    try/catch blocks for synchronous code and .catch for promises.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unused Code">
    Regularly review and remove unused code to reduce clutter and avoid
    confusion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Commented Code">
    Avoid leaving commented-out code in your codebase. It can be confusing and
    indicate poor version control practices. Use version control systems to keep
    track of code changes instead.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid Liberal Use of External Dependencies">
    Be selective about the external libraries and frameworks you include in your
    project. Each dependency adds to the project's complexity and potential
    security risks. Regularly review and update dependencies to keep the project
    secure and performant.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Code Quality

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Use Object Destructuring">
    Destructure objects to extract multiple properties in a clean and concise
    manner, enhancing code clarity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Favor Immutability">
    Prefer creating new instances of objects and arrays instead of modifying
    existing ones to avoid unintended side effects and improve code reliability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Promises and Async/Await">
    Utilize Promises and async/await for handling asynchronous operations, which
    enhances code readability and simplifies error handling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid Side Effects">
    Design functions to avoid changing state or modifying external variables,
    ensuring predictability and ease of testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)">
    Strive to reduce repetition by abstracting repeated logic into reusable
    functions or modules, which makes your codebase more maintainable and easier
    to update.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Atomic Functions">
    Write small, single-purpose functions that perform one task well. This makes
    your code more modular, easier to test, and simpler to understand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Typing">
    Use type annotations throughout your codebase. This helps catch errors early
    during development, improves documentation, and enhances support in code
    editors through features like auto-completion and type checking.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Branch Guidelines

<Steps>

1. Start each branch with your chosen name tag for ease of identification.
2. End it with a slash.
3. Follow it with the issue ticket number to link it to it's card.
4. End it in an hyphen.
5. Then add the issue ticket title as a description.
6. Use hyphens to separate the words of the description.
7. Use only alphanumberic lower cased characters and hyphens.

</Steps>

```bash
nametag/123-user-validation
```

## Commit Guidelines

<Steps>

1. Keep each commit as unitary as possible.
2. Ensure each commit keeps the code functional, without breaking anything.
3. Use a prefix in your commit message that describes the type of change.
4. Follow it with the scope of the change.
5. Provide a concise and descriptive commit message detailing the changes introduced.
6. Ensure that your commit message starts with a present tense verb.
7. Use only alphanumberic lower cased characters and hyphens.

</Steps>

<Card title="Commit Message Types">

- `chore:`: Includes commits related to project maintenance tasks.
- `ci:`: Sets up or updates continuous integration configuration.
- `docs:`: Updates or adds documentation.
- `feat:`: Introduces a new feature.
- `fix:`: Addresses a bug or defect.
- `refactor:`: Restructures code without changing its external behavior.
- `style:`: Makes non-functional changes like formatting.
- `test:`: Adds or modifies tests.

</Card>

Example:

```bash
feat(user): add user validation
```

## Merge Request Guidelines

<Steps>

1. Aim to create small merge requests.
2. Review and test your own code.
3. For a single commit, the title should be the subject of the commit message.
4. For multiple commits, the title should summarise the set of commits.
5. Add the purpose of the branch in the description. What is it changing?
6. Assign it to yourself.
7. Add one or more reviewers.

</Steps>

<Aside
  type="danger"
  title="To ensure your code is up to date, please use rebase instead of merge"
/>

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

You might have commits to pull and to push. Make sure you _push_ them after resolving any potential conflicts.

```bash
git push -f
```

This ensures the commit history is nice, clean and easy to read.

## Code Review Process

<Aside
  type="caution"
  title="All pull requests undergo a code review process to ensure quality, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards."
/>

### Here's what to expect during code review

<Steps>

1. The Git Master or a team reviewer will assess your code for functionality, clarity, efficiency, and adherence to coding conventions.
2. Feedback and suggestions for improvement will be provided through comments on your pull request.
3. You'll have the opportunity to discuss feedback and make necessary changes before merging.

</Steps>

### Tips for a Smooth Code Review

- Focus each pull request on a single feature or bug fix.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Include relevant documentation updates or tests alongside code changes.
- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback.
